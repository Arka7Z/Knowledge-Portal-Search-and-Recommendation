The simplest form MARL is independent (InRL), where each agent treats all its experience as part (non stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit other agents' during training, failing sufficiently generalize execution. We introduce new metric, joint-policy correlation, quantify effect. describe meta-algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses mixtures generated learning, and empirical game theoretic analysis compute meta-strategies policy selection. generalizes previous algorithms such InRL, iterated response, double oracle, fictitious play. Then, propose scalable implementation which reduces memory requirement decoupled meta-solvers.
