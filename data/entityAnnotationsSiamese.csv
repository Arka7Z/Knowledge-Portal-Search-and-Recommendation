reinforcement learning in video game,2154480527,Stronger CDA strategies through empirical game-theoretic analysis and reinforcement learning,"We present general methodology to automate the search for equilibrium strategies in games derived from computational experimentation. Our approach interleaves empirical game-theoretic analysis with reinforcement learning. apply this classic Continuous Double Auction game, conducting most comprehensive CDA strategic study published date. Empirical game confirms prior findings about relative performance of known strategies. Reinforcement learning derives new bidding environment. Iterative application yields stronger than any other policy, culminating Nash supported exclusively by our learned","Double auction, Artificial intelligence, Game theory, Machine learning, Reinforcement learning, Computer science, Bidding, Nash equilibrium",0

reinforcement learning in video game,2142377488,Reinforcement learning with n-tuples on the game connect-4,"Learning complex game functions is still difficult task. We apply temporal difference learning (TDL), well-known variant of the reinforcement approach, in combination with n-tuple networks to Connect-4. Our agent trained just by self-play. It able, for first time, consistently beat optimal-playing Minimax (in situations where win possible). The network induces mighty feature space: not necessary design certain features, but learns select right ones. believe that an important ingredient overall success and identify several aspects are relevant achieving high-quality results. architecture sufficiently general be applied similar tasks as well.","Semi-supervised learning, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Learning classifier system, Active learning (machine learning), Temporal difference learning, Multi-task learning, Computer science, Reinforcement learning, Unsupervised learning, Robot learning",0

natural language interface,60769873,A Controlled Natural Language Interface for Semantic Media Wiki Using the Rabbit Language,"Despite their potential value as collaborative knowledge editing systems, semantic wikis present number of usability challenges. One way to respond these challenges is develop controlled natural language (CNL) interfaces for wiki systems. In this paper, we our efforts CNL interface using the Rabbit language. We firstly an architectural model support community specific system, namely Semantic Media Wiki (SMW), and CNL, Rabbit. then describe set meta-model extensions SMW that enable it representation highly expressive models. Finally, online prototype system based on enables users create content Future development will focus provision improved parsing capabilities. addition, aim extend accommodate multiple CNLs, such Sydney OWL Syntax (SOS) Attempto Controlled English (ACE).

efficient estimation of word representations in vector space,2799894091,From Word to Sense Embeddings: A Survey on Vector Representations of Meaning.,"Over the past years, distributed representations have proven effective and flexible keepers of prior knowledge to be integrated into downstream applications. This survey is focused on semantic representation meaning. We start from theoretical background behind word vector space models highlight one their main limitations: meaning conflation deficiency, which arises representing with all its possible meanings as single vector. Then, we explain how this deficiency can addressed through transition level more fine-grained senses (in broader acceptation) method for modelling unambiguous lexical present comprehensive overview wide range techniques in two branches sense representation, i.e., unsupervised knowledge-based.
