Big Data Framework,2238147262,Recent Developments on Security and Reliability in Large-Scale Data Processing with MapReduce,"The demand to access large volume of data, distributed across hundreds or thousands machines, has opened new opportunities in commerce, science, and computing applications. MapReduce is paradigm that offers programming model an associated implementation for processing massive datasets parallel fashion, by using non-dedicated hardware. It been successfully adopted several academic industrial projects Big Data Analytics. However, since such analytics increasingly demanded within the context mission-critical applications, security reliability frameworks are strongly required order manage sensible information, obtain right answer at time. In this paper, authors present main paradigm, provided Apache with name Hadoop. They illustrate concerns large-scale data infrastructure. review available solutions, their limitations support frameworks. conclude describing undergoing evolution possible issues improvements, which could be challenging research researchers.","Computer science, Data-intensive computing, Data mining, Programming paradigm, Analytics, Software, Big data, Data science, Data processing",0
Novel-word pronunciation within a text-to-speech system,55594375,Articulatory synthesis and perception of plosive-vowel syllables with virtual consonant targets.,"Virtual articulatory targets are concept to explain the different trajectories of primary and secondary articulators during consonant production, as well places tongue-palate contact depending on context vowel, for example in [igi] vs. [ugu]. The virtual tongue tip body apical dorsal plosives assumed lie above palate, bilabial consonants, target is negative degree lip opening. In present study, we discuss its application speech synthesis. particular, examined how location affects acoustics intelligibility synthetic plosive-vowel syllables. It turned out that about 10 mm beyond consonantal closure allow more precise reproduction natural signals than at distance mm. However, found no effect intellegibility consonants.","Intelligibility (communication), Speech recognition, Consonant, Articulatory synthesis, Perception, Speech synthesis, Computer science, Vowel",0
